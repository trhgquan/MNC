\section{Aims and Objectives}
\subsection{Aim}
\begin{itemize}
\item To develop an efficient and accurate text classification model that can accurately categorize text data into predefined categories for a variety of applications.
\item To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach among other shallow/deep learning approaches by comparing it against some models of interest on several evaluation metrics.
\item To explore the potential of using knowledge distillation techniques to compress large language models such as BERT and create smaller, more efficient models for text classification.
\item To evaluate the impact of different feature engineering techniques on the performance of shallow learning models for text classification tasks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Investigating existing approaches on current literature solving the Text Classification problem.
\item Identifying the advantages and disadvantages of existing approaches.
\item Developing a lighter, cheaper and faster approach for Text Classification using DistilBERT.
\item Evaluating the proposed approach using several metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1
\end{itemize}
