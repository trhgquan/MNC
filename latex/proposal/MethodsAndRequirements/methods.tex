\subsection{Research methodology}
On Text Classification, we utilize a large language model (LLM) that has been fine-tuned and distilled on accessible task-specific datasets. We next compare the proposed approach to several models of relevance (including shallow approaches using Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, SVM and deep approaches using CNNs, RNN, or transformers like BERT) on numerous evaluation measures including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score to illustrate its efficiency in comparison to previous shallow/deep learning approaches.

Finally, we analyze the results (e.g., about error analysis, feature importance analysis, and model interpretability methods) to draw insights and conclusions about the research question. These improvements we leave to future research.
