\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}{Conclusion} 
\begin{itemize}
\item In this work, we propose the method of using DistilBERT -- a cheaper, lighter, and faster version of BERT -- for Text Classification. Even though reducing the number of layers (e.g., attention heads), DistilBERT still shows its efficiency by the comparable achievements.
\item However, in this work, we only focus on investigating the architecture used without considering how to integrate more useful information (e.g., structural or hierarchical) to capture more meaningful contextual features. We leave this for future research.
