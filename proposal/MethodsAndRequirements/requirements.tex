\subsection{Research requirements}
To conduct research in text classification, several requirements should be considered:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Corpus: A large and diverse dataset of text documents is required for training and evaluation of the text classification model in case of use for a specific application.
\item Computing Resources: Deep learning models require significant computing resources for training and inference. High-performance computing resources, such as Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), are often used for training deep learning models.
\item Financial Allocation: Financial support is the paramount need for publishing scientific research.
\end{enumerate}
