\section{Aims and Objectives}
\subsection{Aim}
\begin{itemize}
\item To propose DistilBERT as a new approach to Text Classification.
\item To demonstrate the efficiency of DistilBERT among other shallow and deep learning approaches by comparing it with other recent approaches.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Survey on existing approaches to the Text Classification problem.
\item Identify the advantages and disadvantages of existing approaches.
\item Develop a lighter, cheaper and faster approach for Text Classification using DistilBERT.
\item Evaluate the proposed approach using several metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1
\end{itemize}
