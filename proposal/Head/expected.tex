\section{Expected outcomes/deliverables}
We expect the outcomes of our research to be improved accuracy and efficiency in text classification tasks. The proposed model should be able to correctly classify text inputs with high precision and recall, while also being able to process large volumes of text data in a timely manner. Additionally, the model should ideally require fewer computational resources than existing models, making it more practical for use in real-world applications. Ultimately, the success of a proposed text classification model is determined by its ability to outperform existing approaches and improve the state-of-the-art in the field.
